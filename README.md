# My Personal Website 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am using this website to share my personal projects, hardware designs, and hobbies. 

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student passionate about bridging the gap between software, AI, and hardware. I enjoy creating dynamic applications and bringing electronic circuits to life.

## 🛠️ Projects & Areas of Interest
* **Mobile & Web Development:** Building cross-platform applications using Flutter.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Exploring deep learning and computer vision. Currently, I am in the development phase of training an AI model for my real-time piano feedback project, *Keysnake*.
